## Project facts
- Product: WakeTok — local-first personal media Rediscovery Player (iOS; Flutter UI + Swift native media layer)
- Flutter project name: `waketok`; device display name: WakeTok
- Bundle ID: `com.dennycgan.waketok`
  - Explicit App ID registration in Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles: owner-only
  - App Store Connect app-record: created — App name `WakeTok` reserved
    (primary language English (UK)); further ASC configuration remains owner-only
  - See `release-handoff.mdc`
- iOS deployment target: iOS 18.0 (see ADR-007; ADR-005 superseded)
- Test devices: iPhone 13 (performance floor), iPhone 17 (current-device compat)
- No backend, no custom auth, no remote database, no developer-owned media server (kickoff Tech Stack)
- Repository visibility: Private (see Known debt for public eligibility + pre-flight scan)

## Capability Roadmap (project-level; top-to-bottom = execution order; YOU ARE HERE)
- [x] Project Bootstrap (flutter create scaffold, pigeon/ placeholder, docs skeleton, root commit)
- [x] POC-04: Flutter Media Feed Architecture Gate (must pass before production domain/data/feature implementation)
- [x] POC-03: Lock-screen continuous playback gate (must pass before production domain/data/feature implementation)
- [x] POC-09: Current Photos Representation Export Gate
      (must pass before production physical-clip implementation)
- [x] App Foundation
      (gen_l10n + ARB localisation infrastructure, shared error/result
      contracts, production Pigeon contract baseline)
- [x] iOS Photos permission, Library access, iCloud asset state handling
      (phase 5.1 establishes theme token baseline; token-only styling
      from this capability onward — ADR-009)
- [x] All / Photos / Videos built-in source resolution
      (production resolution must enumerate the FULL library including
      iCloud-only assets; device-local filtering is spike-only; acceptance
      includes date-distribution sampling on owner's real 40k library)
- [x] Main Browse Screen and vertical Media Feed
      (ADR-014; Cap 7.7a Profile V-hard PASS; accent/brandGold freeze
      `0e3eec2`; Release hang Known debt separate)
- [ ] Media Info Overlay, loading states, empty states,
      POC-10 file-size semantics,
      optional best-effort Location Label (not release-blocking)
      <-- YOU ARE HERE
- [ ] Live Photo rendering and static fallback (POC-08)
- [ ] Asset Source and Source Pool Definition domain models
- [ ] Live Resolution, Asset Source Availability,
      Identity Coalescing, and Resolved Pool Snapshot
- [ ] Session Queue, Default Session Profile,
      and stable Item Ordering Semantics
- [ ] Endless Shuffle, Queue Stability, and Session Continuity
- [ ] Build a Pool, Ephemeral Pool, and Source ordering
- [ ] Saved Pool persistence, reopen, management, and capacity limits
- [ ] Auto-play Presets and Mode Eligibility Rule
- [ ] One-item Lookahead Fetch, Waiting for Media, iCloud Fallback
- [ ] Background Audio, lock-screen playback, system media controls
- [ ] SessionCheckpoint and Session Recovery
      (Queue, current Media Item, playback position,
      Waiting for Media, and process-termination contract)
- [ ] Physical Clip Export Core
      (fixed 120-second segments, POC-06 and POC-07,
      persistent Export Job / Segment state machine,
      cancellation and recoverable partial success;
      includes ClipExportApi Pigeon contract design,
      deferred from App Foundation)
- [ ] Photos import, backing Album, Clip Descriptor,
      and Generated Clip Source
- [ ] Clip export progress/result UI,
      failed-segment retry, cancellation, and resume UX
- [ ] Share, Mute, Fit / Fill / 9:16 Crop, 2x gesture
- [ ] Add to Album
      (Full Access only; v1.0 scope;
      the only pre-authorized downgrade-to-1.1 item)
- [ ] Settings and localisation completion
      (English/zh-Hans copy, privacy/storage/about screens,
      Light/Dark layout verification)
- [ ] Final real-device performance, memory,
      accessibility, privacy, and error-state hardening
- [ ] TestFlight internal testing and release-candidate validation
      (owner executes distribution; Cursor prepares build and metadata)
- [ ] App Store metadata, screenshots, privacy disclosures,
      submission, and release verification
      (owner executes submission; Cursor prepares assets only)

> Each line is a capability, not a sub-step. Completed capabilities stay one line
> (phase snapshots -> docs/PHASE_HISTORY.md). Only the ACTIVE capability is
> expanded in the Phase Roadmap below.
> PoC placement:
> - POC-01 is closed as Failed and is not scheduled again.
> - POC-02 (Query Source) and POC-05 (CarPlay) are deferred outside MVP.
> - POC-04, POC-03, and POC-09 are closed project gates (see DECISIONS).
> - App Foundation is closed (see PHASE_HISTORY).
> - POC-06, POC-07, POC-08, and POC-10 run inside the capability
>   that consumes their result.
> Top-to-bottom = current execution order. Reorder if priorities change; never leave it unordered.

## Phase Roadmap (active capability only)
Active capability: Media Info Overlay, loading states, empty states,
POC-10 file-size semantics, optional best-effort Location Label
(not release-blocking)

> Owner-approved Cap 8 design lock (Q1=B Location deferred/hide row 4;
> Q2=B forced-dark = Browse pane + shared bottom bar when destination
> is non-Settings; Settings follows Appearance; Q3=A Tier 1 unavailable
> → Tier 3/4 only; Q4=A Live Photo label from mediaKind; Q5=A current
> page only). Field-progressive Presentation Metadata (per-field nullable,
> render on arrival). Location “current Item only” remains a hard rule
> independent of any future ±1 metadata prefetch. Cap 7.8 debts paid in
> 8.2 (do not merge those rows when scheduling).

> Legend: [x] done  [~] in progress  [ ] todo  (blocked) noted inline
> When the active capability changes, replace this entire Phase Roadmap with the
> new capability's phases and move YOU ARE HERE above.
> Phase Roadmap is set by the owner before work begins on each capability.
> When YOU ARE HERE moves, do not generate Phase Roadmap content without
> explicit owner approval of the phases.

- [x] 8.1 Contract freeze: Overlay four-row contract (row 4 omitted this
      Cap); POC-10 Tier policy (Tier 1 Unavailable; Tier 2 slot; enable
      3/4); immersive chrome scope Q2=B; progressive field updates;
      ADR-015 wide draft approved in chat (Accepted at 8.2 work `a721bdc`)
- [x] 8.2 Immersive Browse chrome: forced-dark for Browse/Clips/Auto
      destinations; shared bottom bar always dark (even on Settings);
      Settings *pane* follows Appearance. Initial work `a721bdc`
      (ADR-015). Revision `5fb93de` (ADR-016): transparent top + compact
      custom bar. Fix `60f3283` (ADR-017): bar always dark on Settings.
      Pays forced-dark + opaque-top Known debts.
- [x] 8.3 Presentation Metadata: Pigeon + gateway + domain; current-page
      only; two HostApi calls (`requestPresentationMetadata` then
      `requestPresentationFileSize`) for progressive fields
      (`creationDateMs?`, required `mediaKind` on success,
      `fileSizeBytes?`, `fileSizeSemantics?`); host Tier 3/4
      implemented. Work `c0c04e1`. Feature-layer FeedMediaRequestGate
      staleness discard + tests land with 8.5 Overlay (semantics frozen
      here / ADR-015 Decision 3 — not re-opened at 8.5; implementation
      deferred so no orphan helper without Overlay consumer).
- [x] 8.4 POC-10: device-confirm safe Tier 3/4 paths already in `c0c04e1`;
      M1–M6 PASS; M7 N/A (no RAW+JPEG in owner library); Browse hitch
      qualitative OK. Notes: docs/acceptance/cap8-8.4-poc10-notes.md
      (2026-08-09). Temporary debug probe discarded (never on `main`).
      No host fix; no new ADR.
- [ ] 8.5 Media Info Overlay UI: fixed-height rows 1–3; row 4 omitted;
      progressive per-field paint (size may update in place); ARB;
      `Live Photo` copy when `mediaKind == livePhoto`; wire metadata
      requests through existing FeedMediaRequestGate (staleness discard
      tests with Overlay consumer)
- [ ] 8.6 Loading / Empty product polish (resolve + per-page); no
      Waiting for Media / Source Availability product surfaces
- [ ] 8.7 Location deferral close-out (lightweight): confirm Overlay row 4
      omitted in UI; Known debt row already recorded at design lock —
      no geocoding work this Cap
- [ ] 8.8 Real-device acceptance: overlay height stability; file-size
      sample semantics; coarse hitch sanity (not a Cap 7.7a re-gate)
- [ ] 8.9 Cap 8 close-out: STATE + PHASE_HISTORY; Location debt remains
      (forced-dark / opaque-top cleared at 8.2 docs)

## Now working on (describe ONLY the in-progress item)
- Goal (one line): Cap 8.4 closed; next 8.5 Media Info Overlay UI
- Sub-steps done: 8.1–8.3; 8.4 device confirm (M1–M6 PASS, M7 N/A)
      notes `cap8-8.4-poc10-notes.md`
- Next step: owner go 8.5 (Overlay rows 1–3 + gate staleness wiring)
- Related decisions: ADR-001 … ADR-017; Release hang → Final hardening;
      Location Known debt; file-size disclaimer copy Known debt;
      Portfolio scan remains owner-only; M7 RAW+JPEG size path still
      unverified on owner library

## Known debt / intentionally deferred
| Capability | Item | Reason | Picks it up | Related ADR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Main Browse Screen | Release build Severe Hang / hitch on production feed (Kafka) | Accidental Release campaign V-hard FAIL (`cap7-7.7-notes.md`); **7.7a Profile PASS**. Evidence strength: **All** surface clean **3/3 FAIL (Release) → 3/3 PASS (Profile)** is a strong signal the mode divergence is real (not a one-off flip); **Videos** was already 2/3 PASS on Release (intermittent), so weaker as a divergence signal. Track for shipping; do not deep-dive cause here | Final real-device performance, memory, accessibility, privacy, and error-state hardening | ADR-001 / ADR-014 |
| Media Info Overlay | Location Label (reverse geocode) not implemented | Owner Cap 8 Q1=B: hide Overlay row 4 this Cap (kickoff ADR-X best-effort deferral). Current-Item-only geocode hard rule unchanged when a later Cap picks this up | Later Cap (or reopen when Owner schedules) | kickoff ADR-X |
| Media Info Overlay | File-size disclaimer copy (kickoff ADR-W §5) unset | Size is logical resource bytes — not device disk / iCloud quota / optimized-local / immediate free-on-delete. Not an eng Decision gap; needs user-visible copy landing | Settings and localisation completion (or Cap 8.5/8.6 if a short on-media note is added) | kickoff ADR-W |
| POC-03 | WeChat/VoIP interrupt: no auto-resume on lock screen or iOS home without opening app | Q1=B: 3.3 PASS when shouldResume + poll/foreground resumes; suspended lock/home path deferred | Production Background Audio | ADR-002 |
| POC-03 | Real physical-clip integration after POC-09 (≥3 exported clips locked queue) | Bundle WAV proved service shape only; confirm Photos-backed segments, order, Now Playing, no Dart per transition | Production Background Audio (prerequisite: Generated Clip Source available after Physical Clip Export Core + Photos import) | ADR-002 |
| POC-03 | iCloud Asset download interrupt during background audio | P2=A: out of POC-03 scope | Production Background Audio | ADR-002 |
| POC-09 | Slow-motion frame-rate / audio-pitch beyond duration gate | 9.3 passed duration only | Physical Clip Export Core | ADR-004 |
| POC-09 | Multi-audio-track selection UX | 9.4 default track only | POC-07 | ADR-004 |
| App Foundation | iOS 18 simulator smoke (no 18.x runtime installed) | Floor is 18.0 (ADR-007); day-to-day verify on 26.x only | Final real-device performance, memory, accessibility, privacy, and error-state hardening | ADR-007 |
| App Foundation | Localization Inventory auto-generation/report tooling (kickoff ADR-U §7–8 summary artifact) | Hardcoded-copy scan + ARB key parity closed by ADR-012; Inventory report generator still deferred | Settings and localisation completion | — (kickoff ADR-U) / ADR-012 |
| App Foundation | App icon asset set | Owner parallel track; required before first TestFlight build upload | TestFlight internal testing | — |
| Portfolio | Repository visibility: Private → Public (eligibility: first demoable vertical slice — Main Browse feed scrolls real Photos library content on device) | Cap 7 closed — eligibility met. Before Private→Public, owner must complete the pre-public privacy/sensitive-history scan checklist (local release-handoff); Cursor reminds only and must not run the scan. | Owner pre-public scan (any time after Cap 7) | — |
| iOS Photos permission | NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription is PLACEHOLDER copy | Final permission wording is owner-only (release-handoff) | TestFlight internal testing | — |
| iOS Photos permission | List-time availability via undocumented PHAssetResource KVC `locallyAvailable` | No public isLocallyAvailable on PHAsset/PHAssetResource in the iOS SDK | Final real-device performance, memory, accessibility, privacy, and error-state hardening (or when Apple exposes a public API) | — |
| Cap 6 / library_smoke | Library Totals Shell error row uses raw exception string (`'${asyncTotals.error}'`), not ARB | Predates ADR-012 smoke hardening; Cap 6.4 left untouched on purpose | Settings and localisation completion | ADR-012 |
| Main Browse Screen | No architecture scan for hardcoded `TextStyle(` in `lib/features/**` (typography tokens exist; `Color(0x` still scanned) | Cap 7.2 locked type roles without a TextStyle literal guard; easy to bypass tokens while 7.4–7.7 chrome lands | Settings and localisation completion | ADR-009 / ADR-014 |
| Main Browse Screen | Video page swipe may flash one frame of the previous video | Shared 1+1 AVPlayer + single Platform View (ADR-006); Cap 7.7 observe-only (always-on; orthogonal to hang — see `cap7-7.7-notes.md`) | Final real-device performance, memory, accessibility, privacy, and error-state hardening | ADR-006 |
